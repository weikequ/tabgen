# Requirements Document

## Introduction

TabularSearch is an AI-powered research application that transforms unstructured information gathering into structured, tabular data. The application allows users to define research fields (columns) and automatically populate rows with AI-researched information from multiple sources, presenting results in an intuitive Excel-like interface. The system emphasizes source transparency, parallel processing efficiency, and flexible data export capabilities.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Core Research Interface

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to create custom research tables with defined fields, so that I can structure my information gathering process and get consistent, comparable data across multiple research subjects.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user creates a new research table THEN the system SHALL provide an interface to define column headers and data types
2. WHEN a user defines a research field THEN the system SHALL allow specification of field type (text, number, date, URL, etc.)
3. WHEN a user adds a new row THEN the system SHALL provide input fields for the research subject or query
4. WHEN a user initiates research THEN the system SHALL populate cells with AI-researched information based on the field definitions and row context

### Requirement 2: Multi-Source Information Retrieval

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to gather information from various sources including web search, PDFs, and specific pages, so that I can get comprehensive and diverse research results.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system performs research THEN it SHALL support web search as a data source
2. WHEN the system performs research THEN it SHALL support PDF document analysis as a data source
3. WHEN the system performs research THEN it SHALL support specific webpage analysis as a data source
4. WHEN a user specifies source preferences THEN the system SHALL prioritize those sources in the research process
5. WHEN multiple sources are available THEN the system SHALL aggregate and synthesize information from multiple sources

### Requirement 3: Source Citation and Transparency

**User Story:** As a researcher, I want to see citations and sources for all researched information, so that I can verify accuracy and maintain research integrity.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN information is populated in a cell THEN the system SHALL provide clickable citations showing the source
2. WHEN a user clicks on a citation THEN the system SHALL display the original source with highlighted relevant sections
3. WHEN information comes from multiple sources THEN the system SHALL list all contributing sources
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include citation information in the export format

### Requirement 4: Asynchronous Parallel Processing

**User Story:** As a premium user, I want research to happen in parallel across multiple cells, so that I can get results faster and work more efficiently.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user initiates research on multiple cells THEN the system SHALL process requests in parallel
2. WHEN parallel processing is active THEN the system SHALL show real-time progress indicators for each cell
3. WHEN one cell completes research THEN the system SHALL display results immediately without waiting for other cells
4. WHEN system resources are limited THEN the system SHALL queue requests and process them as resources become available

### Requirement 5: Credit-Based Usage Tracking

**User Story:** As a service provider, I want to track and limit usage through a credit system, so that I can manage costs and provide tiered service levels.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user performs research THEN the system SHALL deduct credits based on the complexity and sources used
2. WHEN a user's credits are low THEN the system SHALL notify them before they run out
3. WHEN a user runs out of credits THEN the system SHALL prevent new research requests until credits are replenished
4. WHEN displaying usage THEN the system SHALL show current credit balance and usage history
5. WHEN different service tiers exist THEN the system SHALL apply appropriate credit costs and limits

### Requirement 6: Data Export and Integration

**User Story:** As a user, I want to export my research tables in various formats, so that I can use the data in other tools and workflows.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user requests export THEN the system SHALL support CSV format export
2. WHEN a user requests export THEN the system SHALL support Excel format export
3. WHEN a user requests export THEN the system SHALL support JSON format export
4. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL include citation information in a structured format
5. WHEN exporting data THEN the system SHALL preserve data types and formatting

### Requirement 7: User Interface and Experience

**User Story:** As a user, I want an intuitive spreadsheet-like interface, so that I can easily navigate and manage my research data without a steep learning curve.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user opens the application THEN the system SHALL present a familiar grid-based interface similar to Excel
2. WHEN a user interacts with cells THEN the system SHALL provide standard spreadsheet operations (select, copy, paste, etc.)
3. WHEN research is in progress THEN the system SHALL show clear loading states and progress indicators
4. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL display helpful error messages with suggested actions
5. WHEN the interface loads THEN the system SHALL be responsive and work across desktop and tablet devices

### Requirement 8: Manual Research Control and Refinement

**User Story:** As a user, I want to manually regenerate research results with custom prompting, so that I can refine results and get more targeted information when the initial research doesn't meet my needs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user right-clicks on a cell THEN the system SHALL provide an option to regenerate the research
2. WHEN a user chooses to regenerate THEN the system SHALL allow them to add custom prompting or instructions
3. WHEN a user regenerates a row THEN the system SHALL allow regeneration of all cells in that row with consistent context
4. WHEN a user regenerates a column THEN the system SHALL allow regeneration of all cells in that column with consistent field definition
5. WHEN regenerating with custom prompts THEN the system SHALL preserve the original result as a version for comparison
6. WHEN multiple versions exist THEN the system SHALL allow users to switch between different research attempts

### Requirement 9: Open Source and Community Features

**User Story:** As a developer or contributor, I want access to the source code and ability to contribute, so that I can customize the tool and help improve it for the community.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the application is released THEN the system SHALL make source code available under an open source license
2. WHEN developers want to contribute THEN the system SHALL provide clear contribution guidelines and documentation
3. WHEN users want to self-host THEN the system SHALL provide deployment documentation and scripts
4. WHEN the community creates extensions THEN the system SHALL support a plugin or extension architecture
